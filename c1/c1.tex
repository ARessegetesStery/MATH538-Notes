\section{Lie Algebra}

\begin{definition}[Lie Algebra]
    Let $\F$ be a field. A \textbf{Lie Algebra} is a vector space $L$ over $\F$ equipped with a bilinear map $[\cdot, \cdot]: L \times L \to L$ (the \textbf{Lie Bracket}) satisfying the following properties:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{Alternating Property}: $[x, x] = 0$ for all $x \in L$. (For $\fchar{\F} \neq 2$, this is equivalent to \underline{antisymmetry}: $[x, y] = -[y, x]$ for all $x, y \in L$.)
        \item \emph{Jacobi Identity}: $[x, [y, z]] + [y, [z, x]] + [z, [x, y]] = 0$ for all $x, y, z \in L$.
    \end{itemize}
    \ 
\end{definition}
\nogap
\begin{remark}
    Throughout this note, for simplicity we will assume that $\fchar{\F} = 0$. Nevertheless, the limitations on field characteristics will be pointed out when it is clear that the result will fall in certain cases.
\end{remark}

\begin{example}
    Consider $V = \F^n$. Notice that $\dim_\F (\End(V)) = \dim_\F (\Mat_n(\F)) = n^2$ as vector spaces over $\F$; and they are further isomorphic. We can further show that they are isomorphic as Lie algebras. 
\end{example}

\begin{proposition}
    Define the Lie bracket on $\End(V)$ by $[f, g] = fg - gf$ (with the product the composition of functions). Then $\End(V)$ is a Lie Algebra.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    It suffices to verify that Lie bracket satisfies the alternating property and the Jacobi identity. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{Alternating Property}: $[f, f] = ff - ff = 0$.
        \item \emph{Jacobi Identity}: 
        \begin{align*}
            [f, [g, h]] + [g, [h, f]] + [h, [f, g]] &= [f, gh - hg] + [g, hf - fh] + [h, fg - gf] \\
            &= f(gh - hg) - (gh - hg)f + g(hf - fh) - (hf - fh)g + h(fg - gf) - (fg - gf)h \\
            &= fgh - fgh - ghf + hgf + ghf - hfg - hfg + fhg + fhg - fgh - gfh + gfh \\
            &= 0.
        \end{align*}
    \end{itemize}
    Bi-linearity results directly from the linearity of functions.
\end{proof}

\begin{notation}
    The Lie algebra $(\End(V), [\cdot, \cdot])$ is denoted by $\liealg{gl}(V)$.
\end{notation}
\nogap
\begin{example}
    Let $V = \R^n$. Then as vector spaces $\End(V) \simeq \Mat_n(\R) \simeq \liealg{gl}(V)$ where $[A, B] = AB - BA$ for $A, B \in \Mat_n(\R)$.
\end{example}

The Lie Algebra $\End(V) \simeq \Mat_n(V) \simeq \liealg{gl}(V)$ has a basis $\{ e_{ij} \}_{i, j = 1}^n$, where $\{e_{ij}\}$ represents the matrix with all zero entries except for $1$ in the $(i, j)$-th entry.

\begin{definition}[Lie Subalgebra]
    A \textbf{Lie Subalgebra} $K \subseteq L$ is a subspace of s.t. for all $x, y \in K$, $[x, y] \in K$.
\end{definition}
\nogap
\begin{definition}[Linear Lie Algebra]
    Any subalgebra of $\liealg{gl}(V)$ is called a \textbf{linear Lie algebra}.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Ado-Iwasawa]\label{thm:ado-iwasawa}
    Every finite dimensional Lie algebra is isomorphic to a linear Lie algebra.
\end{theorem}

The proof of this statement requires more structure and will be deferred; for now we will use this results without proof as this theorem is really powerful.

\TODO{search for proof}

\begin{example}[Classical Lie Algebra]
    The following examples of Lie algebra constitute the \textbf{classical Lie algebra} which are the bulk of existing Lie algebras. As expected, they are closely related to matrices.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Let $V = \F^{n+1}$. The \textbf{special linear algebra} $A_n$ is
        \[
            A_n = \liealg{sl}_{n+1}(V) = \{ g \in \liealg{gl}_{n+1}(V) \mid \Tr{g} = 0 \}
        \]
        As a vector space over $\F$ it has dimension $(n^2 + 2n)$.
        \item Let $V = \F^{2n}$. The \textbf{symplectic algebra} $C_n$ is
        \[
            C_n = \liealg{sp}_{2n}(V) = \{ g \in \liealg{gl}_{2n}(V) \mid sg + g^T s = 0 \}, \quad \text{where } s = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & \Id_n \\ -\Id_n & 0 \end{pmatrix}
        \]
        Considering its dimension, writing also $g \in \liealg{gl}_{2n}(V)$ as $n$-by-$n$ blocks, we have
        \[
            g = 
            \left(\begin{array}{c|c}
                g_1 & g_2 \\
                \hline
                g_3 & g_4
            \end{array}\right)
            \quad
            \implies
            \quad
            sg + g^T s = 
            \left(\begin{array}{c|c}
                g_3 - g_3^T & g_4 + g_1^T \\
                \hline
                g_1 + g_4^T & g_2 - g_2^T
            \end{array}\right)
            = 0
        \]
        Further notice that $(g_4 + g_1^T) = (g_1 + g_4^T)^T$. Then the condition of matrix vanishing becomes equivalent to $g_3 = g_3^T$, $g_2 = -g_2^T$ and $g_1 = -g_4^T$. For a symmetric matrix its dimension is $\frac{1}{2}n(n+1)$, and arbitrary $g_1$ fixes $g_4$, giving dimension $n$. Summing together gives the $\dim_\F C_n = 2n^2 + n$.
        \item Let $V = \F^{2n+1}$. The \textbf{(odd) orthogonal algebra} $B_n$ is
        \[
            B_n = \liealg{o}_{2n+1}(V) = \{ g \in \liealg{gl}_{2n+1}(V) \mid sg + g^T s = 0 \}, \quad \text{where } s = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \Id_n \\ 0 & \Id_n & 0 \end{pmatrix}
        \]
        Considering its dimension, write also $g \in \liealg{gl}_{2n+1}(V)$ in block form:
        \[
            g = 
            \begin{pmatrix}
                x              & a_{1 \times n} & b_{1 \times n} \\
                c_{n \times 1} & m_{n \times n} & n_{n \times n} \\
                d_{n \times 1} & p_{n \times n} & q_{n \times n}
            \end{pmatrix}
            \quad
            \implies
            \quad
            sg + g^T s =
            \begin{pmatrix}
                2x      & a + d^T & b + c^T \\
                a^T + d & p + p^T & q + m^T \\
                b^T + c & m + q^T & n + n^T
            \end{pmatrix}
            = 0
        \]
        This translates to equalities
        \[
            2x = 0, \quad
            a + d^T = (a^T + d)^T = 0, \quad
            b + c^T = (b^T + c)^T = 0, \quad
            q + m^T = (m + q^T)^T = 0, \quad 
            p + p^T = 0, \quad
            n + n^T = 0
        \]
        This gives $x = 0$. Fixing $a$ and $b$ fixes $d$ and $c$, of which there are $2n$ choices. Fixing $m$ fixes $q$, of which there are $n^2$ choices. It is also required that both $n$ and $p$ are anti-symmetric matrices, i.e. they have zeros on the diagonal, and fixing upper triangle elements fixes the whole matrix, of which there are $\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)$ choices. Then
        \[
            \dim_\F B_n = 2n + n^2 + 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} n(n-1) = 2n^2 + n
        \]
        \item Let $V = \F^{2n}$. The \textbf{(even) orthogonal algebra} $D_n$ is
        \[
            D_n = \liealg{o}_{2n}(V) = \{ g \in \liealg{gl}_{2n}(V) \mid sg + g^T s = 0 \}, \quad \text{where } s = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & \Id_n \\ \Id_n & 0 \end{pmatrix}
        \]
        Considering its dimension, use the similar strategy as above. Write $g \in \liealg{gl}_{2n}(V)$ in block form:
        \[
            g = 
            \begin{pmatrix}
                m & n \\
                p & q
            \end{pmatrix}
            \quad \implies \quad
            sg + g^T s =
            \begin{pmatrix}
                p + p^T & q + m^T \\
                m + q^T & n + n^T
            \end{pmatrix}
            = 0
        \]
        The equality translates to the following conditions
        \[
            p + p^T = 0, \quad
            q + m^T = (m + q^T)^T = 0, \quad
            n + n^T = 0
        \]
        Fixing $p$ fixes $m$, and both $p$ and $n$ are anti-symmetric matrices, which have dimension $\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)$ over $\F$. This gives
        \[
            \dim_\F D_n = n^2 + 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}n(n-1) = 2n^2 - n
        \] 
    \end{enumerate}
    \ 
\end{example}
